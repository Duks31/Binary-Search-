# Binary-Search-

Here, I compared Binary search Algorithm and the normal search for an array, All in Python 

Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in only sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
It is Kinda like a Divide and Conquer ðŸ˜‚.
The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to (O(Log n) from Big O Notation ).
